##Overview

This repository demonstrates an integration to the triPOS product.

##Prerequisites

Please contact your Integration Team member for any questions about the below prerequisites.

* After you clone this repository download gson-2.3.1.jar from: http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/ and place it in the libs folder within the triPOS.Java folder.  This library is used to convert JSON to/from Java objects.
* Register and download the triPOS application: https://mft.elementps.com/backend/plugin/Registration/ (once activated, login at https://mft.elementps.com)
* Create Express test account: http://www.elementps.com/Resources/Create-a-Test-Account
* Install and configure triPOS
* Optionally install a hardware peripheral and obtain test cards (but you can be up and running without hardware for testing purposes)
* Currently triPOS is supported on Windows 7

##Documentation/Troubleshooting

* triPOS provides an embedded API documentation feature.  Simply point your favorite browser to:  http://localhost:8080/help/ (for a default install) and the triPOS API documentation anticipates your questions.
* In addition to the help documentation above triPOS writes information to a series of log files located at:  C:\Program Files (x86)\Vantiv\triPOS Service\Logs (for a default install).

##Step 1: Generate a request package

You can either generate an XML request or a JSON request.  This example shows the JSON request.  Also notice that the value in laneId is 9999.  This is the 'null' laneId meaning a transaction will flow through the system without requiring hardware.  All lanes are configured in the triPOS.config file located at:  C:\Program Files (x86)\Vantiv\triPOS Service (if you kept the default installation directory).  If you modify this file make sure to restart the triPOS.NET service in the Services app to read in your latest triPOS.config changes.

```

##Step 2:Create message headers

##Step 3: Send request to triPOS

Use any http library to send a request to triPOS which is listening on a local address:  http://localhost:8080/api/v1/sale (if you kept the install default).

```
```

##Step 4: Receive response from triPOS



```
